Setting Up Your Deep Learning Environment

**My environment is set up on Windows 10 so these instructions are for same. I can provide more instructions if you want to use Linux (which will probably be necessary if you pursue a cloud solution)

Requirements: 

NVidia GPU, CUDA-compatible
- virtually all modern high-end NVidia GPUs are CUDA-compatible
- Google Cloud / Azure / AWS will provide CUDA-compatible hardware by default should you chose to use them

Visual Studio 2017
Python 3.5 or above
- Latest version of Anaconda3 highly recommended
Tensorflow
Keras v2
CUDA Toolkit
cuDNN


Notes: 
* Install the above items in the order they appear in the list
* Visual Studio 2015 is also fine
* I use only Python 3. Python 2 is ancient.
* I would also recommend doing the above installation on a completely clean OS environment. It usually goes more smoothly.
