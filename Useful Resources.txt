- Understanding the underlying mathematics can be extremely helpful when it comes to selecting hyperparameters for deep learning models. This book doesn't go into deep learning specifically, but it does provide a very good foundation and will significantly help with understanding the mechanics of machine learning. 


I have a lot more but I will stop here for now because that is a lot of content to cover.
